# What is Wheatstone Bridge?

A Wheatstone bridge is an electrical circuit used to measure an unknown electrical resistance by balancing two legs of a bridge circuit, one leg of which includes the unknown component.

We can reorganize our circuit by lengthening/shortening the wires, without changing anything electrically

The program was prepared in the **GNU Octave** environment. I recommend running these files on Octave. The file has the extension **.m**
